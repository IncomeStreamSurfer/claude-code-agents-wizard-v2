TESTING ISSUE: As the TESTER agent, I need to visually verify the Phase 2 Creative Studio implementation using Playwright MCP. However, I cannot directly invoke MCP tools from this environment. I can see that:

1. All pages return 200 HTTP status:
   - /login ✓
   - /creative ✓
   - /creative/generate/image ✓
   - /creative/generate/video ✓
   - /creative/generate/jobs ✓

2. Code inspection shows proper component structure exists

3. Development server is running on port 3001

BUT - I cannot complete my CORE responsibility: taking screenshots and visually verifying that:
- Pages render correctly with all UI elements visible
- Forms have all expected components (brand selector, image type cards, etc.)
- Navigation works between pages
- No visual glitches or layout issues
- Responsive design works properly

QUESTION FOR HUMAN:
How should I proceed with visual verification testing when I cannot directly call Playwright MCP? Should I:
A) Document what I can verify via code inspection and HTTP checks?
B) Request that a human manually test using the test credentials provided?
C) Is there another way to invoke Playwright MCP for automated testing?
